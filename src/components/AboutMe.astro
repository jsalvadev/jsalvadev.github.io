          My name is Salvador Jesus, but I prefer to go by Salva. I started programming with C++ and Codeblocks at 18
          years old, with no prior knowledge. Today, <span>I work as a frontend developer at Vueling</span>, one of the
          most important airlines in Spain.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty">
          Over the years, I have continued <span>learning through tech channels like Midudev</span> ❤️, participated in
          <span>hackathons organized by NUWE</span> and in <span>"La Piscine" at 42 Barcelona</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty">
          Outside the tech world, I love traveling, reading, and watching anime. <span>
            Recently, I've resumed my English studies with a more disciplined approach.
          </span> For 2025, I've set myself the goals of <span>visiting three countries</span> and developing at least
          <span>two freelance projects</span> during my free time.
